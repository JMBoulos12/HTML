    HTML5 provides audio element to embed audio in web page. Prior to HTML5, we are using third party plug-ins, 
    like - Flash, Window Media Center, Apple iTunes, etc to play audio on the browser. 
    The problem with these plug-ins are that, not all browsers or devices support it. 
    HTML5 provides a standard way to include audio with several attributes which improve its default behavior.
    
    The text enclosed within the <audio> element will appear in only those browsers which do not support <audio> element.
